##Story##
Spring 2014 - A beer garden in Munich

I was enjoying some beer with my good friend Mathias, when he reminded me of a tweet I sent him days ago.
I tweeted him because I felt the need to code something with him.

So he came up with this brilliant idea to solve some problems with code and compare the results.
Starting small and getting bigger.

This is the repository for all the challenges.

##Rules##
You bring up a problem to solve.
Everybody has to come up with a solution.
No Google-ing!!!
We compare the results and decide which one's getting the job done the best way.

##Branches##
Each challenge will get it's own branch.
